# Voting with Bismuth

Bismuth introduced Governance and community votes for some core issues.  
First vote takes place during October 2019.

Bismuth Governance uses an innovative protocol to avoid weaknesees of other common voting protocols.

**Warning**:  
Before voting or revealing a vote, make sure you're in the right period for the related motion, or your vote will not be counted.
The dates are clearly specified on the motion page.

## How to vote

Integrated wallet voting will come asap.  
In the mean time, to allow for everyone - whatever the wallet - to vote, we developped a client side only helper.  

- Runs in a browser
- Local only, nothing goes out
- Only needs a BIP39 like word seed for all of your addresses and votes.

### 1. Go the the helper page

Easy way: Hosted on github pages, from the repo code.  
https://bismuthfoundation.github.io/Bismuth-Voting/client-side/dist/index.html

Long way: Clone the repo, get index.html and index.js, run on an airgap computer of yours.

### 2. Get a Master Key

Master Key is your private word seed for all voting related operations.  
Keep it both **private** and **safe** - Backup required. Think of it as your hidden voting identity.

You need only **one** master key for all votes and addresses. A derivation mechanism ensures a unique key will be used in practice for every address and motion.

You can hit "Generate" to get a new key. You can hit until you get one that pleases you.  
You can use a BIP39 word seed generated by another BIP39 tool as well.
Do **not** enter random words there. BIP39 require a precise structure and dictionary. 
May work anyway, but likely to get you in troubles.  

> Next time you come here to vote again or reveal your vote, you will **have to** use the very same Master Key.

### 3. Paste your address, select vote option and BIS amount.

This helper is hardcoded for the first motion. You are voting for the supply change.

The "Wallet address" is **YOUR** address you'll be voting with. It's used to derive a unique voting key for that exclusive address, then motion.

> Make sure your address (RSA or ECDSA) is correctly entered. A mistake in your address means the voting key will be wrong also. 
> Take care of the case also, be consistent!

**Double check the amount** you'll be voting with. Must be less than your balance obviously. That is your voting weight.

### 4. Generate the transaction

Hit the button. This will generate the Bismuth transactions under different formats.

## The transaction formats

### BIS URL Tab

First tab is for wallets supporting bisurl feature (tk_wallet, legacy wallet, Tornado wallet)

![Screen shot](https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-FAQ/raw/master/Voting/vote_tab1.png)

Copy the bisurl (it's a one liner), paste into the wallet, load and send.  

> Make sure you send from the address you set as "wallet address".  
> Make sure your transaction is then visible on the explorer at https://bismtuth.online after a few minutes.

### Raw Txn Tab

Second tab is for wallets without Bisurl feature yet (Like Chameleon mobile Wallet)

![Screen shot](https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-FAQ/raw/master/Voting/vote_tab2.png)

Copy all 4 transactions elements one by one (recipient, amount, operation, data) then send.

> Make sure you send from the address you set as "wallet address".  
> Make sure your transaction is then visible on the explorer at https://bismtuth.online after a few minutes.

### Pawer Tab

Third tab is for The pawer wallet, our discord integrated wallet.

![Screen shot](https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-FAQ/raw/master/Voting/vote_tab3.png)

Copy the command string (it's a one liner), paste it in a DM to `@pawer`.

> Make sure you send from the address you set as "wallet address" (`pawer deposit` will give it to you).  
> Make sure your transaction is then visible on the explorer at https://bismtuth.online after a few minutes.

### Advanced/Debug Tab

Debug and internal info you shouldn't need.  
If you want to be extra safe, you can copy this info and keep it safe.
