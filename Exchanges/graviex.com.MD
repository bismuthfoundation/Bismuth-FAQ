## Account setup

First of all you’ll need to create an account on [graviex.net](https://graviex.net), this is an easy step so I will skip it. Second it is highly recommended for 
your account security to activate 2FA, so go for it. This should be also easy enough for you to set as it is a straight forward operation. 
Just hover over your account email(top right) **My Profile** and enable Two-Factor Authentication, scan the QR code with your mobile app and put the number from the
app in the **Code** field.

## Deposit $BIS

Now since you have set up your account let’s move forward and see how you deposit Bismuth on the exchange. 
Click on "Funds" and then search for Bismuth or type "bis" in the search-field.

Click on **Deposit**.

Now from the Bismuth Deposit page you need to generate a new address. Click on  the symbol right of the empty address-field. If you activated 2FA, you need to enter the actual auth-token from your mobile device.

If it seems, that nothing happened, try **shift+reload** (for example shift+F5). Your new address + the corresponding message should appear.

From your personal wallet go to **Send** tab and fill the **Recipient** field with your exchange address from Point (**1**) put the BIS amount you want 
to send in the **Amount** field and the **OpenField(data)** from Point (**2**) in the **Data** field of your wallet like in the picture below:

Click **Send Bismuth**, check if everything is OK then hit **Confirm button**. Done!

## Withdraw $BIS 

Withdrawal of the $BIS coins is the same as on any other coin because you don’t need a OpenField(data) since your address is unique.

## Happy trading!
