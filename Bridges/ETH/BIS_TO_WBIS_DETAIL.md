- Once mined, your BIS transfer will show up. Just wait for it to go through the confirmations,
 then for the mint to be signed.

 This can take a while depending on the timing and availability of the signers. **Just be patient**.  
 If your transaction is visible on the BIS chain, it will go through.

## Step 4

## Step 5

You arrive on an already filled form.  
Do not change anything in the params, or your transaction will fail.
